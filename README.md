# basic-networked-multiplayer-game
A basic networked multiplayer game example/template that uses Socket.io and Phaser, with easy to understand, yet detailed explanations of pretty much everything.

The Server.js and Boot.js files should contain all of the instructions and code needed to get a litte networked multiplayer game set up quickly and easily.

If there is anything wrong, any misinformation or if something doesn't work, let me know.
